# Epic React Solutions

This repository will serve as an archive as I work through exercises in  [Kent C. Dodds'](https://github.com/kentcdodds) premium React Course 'Epic React'

Thank you to Kent and the rest of the team at Epic React for putting such a thorough and well structured course together for the benefit of helping level up in React.js
